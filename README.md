# Yul-ERC20-Assembly :fire: :rocket:

Welcome to the **Yul-ERC20-Assembly** repository, a high-performance, low-level ERC-20 token contract written using inline Assembly / Yul for EVM interactions! This project leverages the power of Foundry, a smart contract development toolchain that streamlines your workflow with dependency management, compilation, testing, deployment, and more. :sparkles:

## :computer: What is Yul-ERC20-Assembly?

The Yul-ERC20-Assembly project is a groundbreaking implementation of an ERC20 token contract that utilizes inline Yul Assembly to maximize performance and reduce gas costs. As an amazing and skilled Solidity EVM developer, I've crafted this repository to showcase a unique and efficient approach to token contract development. :muscle:

## :zap: Features

- High-performance token contract using Yul Assembly :racing_car:
- Managed by Foundry, a powerful smart contract development toolchain :wrench:

## :star2: What's Inside

This project includes:

- A Yul-based ERC20 token contract :moneybag:
- Inline assembly (Yul) for an improved developer experience :sunglasses:
- Detailed inline comments and documentation :books:

## :rocket: Get Started

1.  Clone the repository and run the following commands (compile and run the tests). (This assumes you have foundry installed of course):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamadhammoud/yul-ERC20-assembly.git
cd Yul-ERC20-Assembly

```

2.  Compile the contract:

```
forge compile
```

3.  Run tests:

```
forge test
```
